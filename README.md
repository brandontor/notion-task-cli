# Why? 

I :heart: Notion, and if you're here then you probably do too. 

Also maybe like you, I get distracted easily, and because of this i'm afraid to leave my code editor.

>"But what if I could interact with notion from inside my code editor/command line?" 

Well weary traveler look no further: Introducing notion-task-cli  (ntc) :robot:
